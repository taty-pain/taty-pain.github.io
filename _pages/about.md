About me
======
Hi, my name is Xiong. I’m 14 years old and a student who enjoys exploring science, technology, and creative problem-solving. I’ve always been curious about how things work, which is why I spend a lot of time experimenting with robotics, coding, and electronics projects. I like working with sensors, microcontrollers, and different hardware to bring ideas to life, and I enjoy the challenge of turning concepts into something practical.

Outside of my projects, I’m also interested in learning languages, studying history, and improving my skills in different school subjects. I believe in balancing academics with creativity, so I often combine what I learn in class with my personal hobbies. I enjoy taking on challenges, working with others, and finding solutions that make life easier or more interesting. In the future, I hope to keep building new things, learn even more about technology, and contribute ideas that can help people in meaningful ways.

Projects
======
My project is called VTracks, a smart navigation system designed to help blind people and travelers move around more safely and confidently. The idea behind VTracks is to provide real-time guidance by detecting obstacles and giving feedback through vibrations and signals. To achieve this, I integrated multiple sensors including the MPU9250 for motion tracking, the TF-Luna LiDAR for distance measurement, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and the BMP280 barometric sensor for altitude changes. The system also uses MG90S servos and a vibration strap attached to the shoe to provide physical feedback to the user.

The project has gone through several versions, starting with Arduino Uno and later moving to ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for better performance and flexibility. I worked on both hardware connections and coding, making sure the sensors can work together smoothly. The goal of VTracks is to combine engineering with real-world problem solving, offering a navigation tool that can make daily life easier for people with visual impairments while also being useful for general travelers.
